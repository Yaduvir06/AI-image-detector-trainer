# AI-image-detector-trainer
# a robust deep learning model to classify images as authentic or AI-generated, The core of the system is an ensemble architecture that fuses predictions from a custom CNN
 and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16).
 â€¢ Utilized PyTorch for model development, with a focus on advanced data augmentation techniques, learning rate
 scheduling, and comprehensive model evaluation to ensure generalization
 
# Core Libraries

PyTorch (for deep learning)

torchvision (for datasets, transforms, pretrained models including ViT)

Pillow (for image processing)

numpy (for numerical operations)

# Training and Utilities

tqdm (for progress bars)

matplotlib (for plotting, e.g., confusion matrices)

scikit-learn (for metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
